## Daily Progress

| Day   | Task Summary |
|-------|--------------|
| **Phase 1** | Compared RandomForest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost classifiers on the Breast Cancer dataset using accuracy and basic error analysis in a Jupyter Notebook. |
| **Phase 2** | Trained SVM models with Linear, RBF, and Polynomial kernels and visualized their decision boundaries using 2D PCA. |
